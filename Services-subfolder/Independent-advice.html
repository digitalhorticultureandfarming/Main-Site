                After many years of working and undertaking research in horticulture and farming, 
                it was evident that sensor choice, installation and data usage were critical in realising 
                the benefits of integrating sensor technology. We offer independent advice to help you get 
                the best out of sensor technology.

                It can be tempting to install a single sensor unit given the various costs involved when buying 
                and using sensors. Farm variability is one of the most important factors when considering sensor 
                technology. Sensor data needs to reflect this variation to ensure the data properly informs farm 
                management decisions. Another important aspect of using sensors is data validation. After years of
                 working with sensors, poor data quality can be a significant issue. Correct installation and 
                 calibration is critical, but it is also important that regular checks are made to ensure sensor 
                 data is correct.

                Once this fully validated data is collected, what do you do with it. Many companies offer web site 
                apps displaying data and suggest if that data is in a good range. It is critical to link sensor data 
                with actual plant baselines. Depending on grower knowledge and industry research, some of this information 
                might be readily available and can help establish these baselines. We can help you establish these baselines, 
                so crop management decisions can be firmly based on evidence. This will also help as you automate certain 
                aspects of your operation.
