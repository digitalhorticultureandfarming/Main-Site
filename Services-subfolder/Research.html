                Scientific and farm-based research is one of Digital Horticulture & Farming key strengths. 
                The research area most important to sensors and other data inputs (farm records, nutrient analysis, etc) 
                is linking data with plant baselines. Yield and quality are two important baselines. In many crops, 
                industry knowledge and scientific research have helped identify important factors affecting baselines. 
                In many cases though, even where considerable research has been undertaken, a substantial knowledge 
                gap still exists. Farm-based research is often needed to refine important factors and key levels. 
                The key to using the latest technology to optimise every stage of crop and post-harvest management, 
                is quality data that has been linked with plant baselines.
